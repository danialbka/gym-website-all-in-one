Improve forms and feedback

    Display form‑level error messages – when login fails or registration has issues, show clear error messages (e.g., “Incorrect username or password”) instead of silent failures. Use toast notifications or inline form hints.

    Add a confirm‑password field and display password requirements (min length, special characters). Provide a forgot password link.

    Validate weight input client‑side (allow only positive numbers) and ensure that invalid or out‑of‑range values show descriptive messages. Example HTML:

    <label for="weight">Weight (kg)</label>
    <input id="weight" type="number" min="1" max="600" required
           aria-describedby="weightHelp" />
    <small id="weightHelp">Enter your PR weight in kilograms (1‑600).</small>

    Validate the Instagram link with a regex pattern and display a custom error if it isn’t a valid URL. Provide placeholder text such as https://www.instagram.com/reel/... and describe acceptable formats.

    Change the Total PRs metric to 0 when there are no PRs to avoid confusion.

    After updating profile settings or submitting a PR, show a success message (e.g., with a green check‑mark) and clear or reset the form.

Enhance navigation & discoverability

    Highlight active pages in the navigation bar more clearly by using a contrasting background or underline.

    Add tooltips or labels to icons (e.g., dark/light toggle, mobile/PWA icon) using title="Switch to dark mode" and ARIA labels for screen readers.

    On the leaderboard and teams pages, convert rows into clickable buttons or cards with hover effects (e.g., change background on hover) to indicate they are interactive. Add a small arrow icon to suggest navigation.

    Provide breadcrumbs or back links consistently (e.g., at top of profiles) so users know where they are and how to return.

Improve teams & community features

    Replace the current modal for team details with a dedicated team page. Show team stats and members, and provide Join/Leave Team buttons. This eliminates the confusing modal‑behind‑page behaviourgymbakugan.onrender.com.

    Add a search bar to find teams or members and filters for country or gym.

    Allow users to create new teams and send join requests; show pending requests in the profile.

Enhance video experience

    Embed Instagram posts directly into GymRank using Instagram’s oEmbed or embed API. This allows users to watch the video without leaving the site. Show a fallback message if the embed fails. Example with React:

    import { useEffect, useRef } from 'react';

    function InstagramEmbed({ url }) {
      const ref = useRef(null);
      useEffect(() => {
        if (window.instgrm) {
          window.instgrm.Embeds.process();
        }
      }, [url]);
      return (
        <blockquote className="instagram-media" data-instgrm-permalink={url} ref={ref} />
      );
    }

    Provide a video preview thumbnail in the PR card and disable the View button if the URL is invalid. Consider supporting uploads for users who do not have Instagram.

    Add social sharing options and allow users to like or comment on videos within GymRank.

Accessibility & responsiveness

    Ensure all interactive elements (buttons, links) have appropriate aria-label attributes and keyboard focus states. Add role="button" to divs that act as buttons.

    Use semantic HTML (e.g., <nav>, <main>, <section>) to improve screen‑reader support.

    Increase color contrast, especially for text on dark backgrounds, to meet WCAG 2.1 AA guidelines.

    Test the mobile interface thoroughly: enlarge touch targets to at least 48 px, avoid modals requiring precise clicks, and enable swipe gestures for navigating between tabs.

Performance & code quality

    Lazy‑load images and video embeds to reduce initial page load times. Use the loading="lazy" attribute for images.

    Implement client‑side caching or GraphQL queries for leaderboard and team data to prevent reloading each time.

    Consolidate repeated components (cards, modals) into reusable functions or components. This reduces duplicated code and simplifies maintenance.

    Use environment variables to store API keys (e.g., Instagram embed API) and keep them out of the client code.

    Add automated tests for forms and user flows (e.g., login, PR submission) using tools like Cypress.

Conclusion

GymRank has a solid foundation and an appealing concept, but several usability issues reduce its effectiveness. Improving form validation and feedback, clarifying navigation, enhancing video integration, and addressing accessibility will significantly improve user satisfaction. Adopting some of the code and design recommendations above will also make the project easier to maintain and scale. Implementing these improvements will create a more intuitive and inclusive platform for the lifting community.
